        "- **Jest**: A powerful testing framework by Meta, ideal for unit and integration testing. It includes a test runner, assertion library, and mocking capabilities.\n",
        "- **React Testing Library (RTL)**: Focuses on testing components from the user‚Äôs perspective. Encourages best practices by avoiding implementation details.\n",
        "- **Enzyme**: Developed by Airbnb, useful for shallow rendering and component lifecycle testing. Less favored now compared to RTL.\n",
        "- **Cypress**: End-to-end testing tool that runs in the browser. Great for UI and integration testing.\n",
        "- **Playwright**: Modern E2E testing framework supporting multiple browsers. Useful for automation and cross-browser testing.\n",
        "- **Mocha + Chai**: Flexible testing setup for unit and integration tests. Often paired with Sinon for mocking.\n",
        "- **Storybook + Jest/RTL**: Storybook helps visualize components; combined with Jest/RTL for snapshot and interaction testing.\n",
